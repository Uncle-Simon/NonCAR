# Non-Cyclical Alphabet Recollection

Non-Cyclical Alphabet Recollection (NonCAR) is an educational tool designed to enhance your ability to recall what comes before or after a given letter in the alphabet, without the need to sing the alphabet song in your head. For example, if asked what comes after 'h', you should be able to quickly respond with 'i', without needing to mentally recite the sequence "...efghi".
